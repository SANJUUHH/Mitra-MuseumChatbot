# MITRA -Museum Chatbot

This is the chatbot project inspired from the problem statement "	Online Chatbot based ticketing system" from the SIH-2024.

### Short Description: 
Manual ticket booking systems in museums lead to inefficiencies, long queues, and errors, frustrating visitors and harming the museum's reputation.
A multilingual chatbot-based ticketing system is proposed to address these issues by automating bookings, integrating payment gateways, reducing human error, and providing analytics for better decision-making.
